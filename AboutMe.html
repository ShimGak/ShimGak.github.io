        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Wanjiru Gakure, but I prefer to go by Shishi, which is a simplified version of my name. 
        I was born in December, 2001, in Thanet, Kent, but I haven't been restrained to one place. Due to my fathers side, 
        I have been able to travel to travel and live in Kenya for a short period of time, which has helped to understand my heritage.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am currently a Student at Canterbury Christ Church University and have been studying Computing.</p>
